      Architecture is art because a building that is constructed is an expression of the imagination and creativity of whoever is involved in its design. This is why even buildings used for the most mundane of purposes transform into a work of art in the hands of a gifted architect. Moreover, certain architectural wonders, be it a house or a public building like a museum, bears the signature of the architect. They reflect the architect’s personality and beliefs.

The neocortex has ridges, valleys, and folds because the brain kept remodeling itself though space was tight. We take for granted the ridiculous-sounding-yet-undeniable fact that each person carries around atop her body a complete universe in which billions of sensations, thoughts, and desires stream.

      For years, nutrition experts have said that a healthy breakfast is a key start to the day. Not only do we think and perform better on the job, they tell us, it supports our well-being in many other ways. Among these experts is Jessica Crandall, a registered dietitian and a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. "A lot of times, people think they know about nutrition because they eat," she says, "but you need large bodies of science and research to know what our bodies actually need." 
         And the research shows that there are good reasons to eat breakfast.

      No one really knows who invented ice cream. We have bits and pieces of information. It’s enough to put together a basic story, but we don’t have all of the answers. In Ancient Rome, Emperor Nero enjoyed mixing snow with fruit and honey. He frequently sent messengers out to gather snow from the mountains. Some historians credit Marco Polo with being the first one to bring some type of ice cream to Europe. He had learned it from the Chinese, who had flavored snow with rice and milk to make a creamy dessert.

At the time of sunset, one can enjoy the serenity of a sunset. Then nature seems in a hurry. People finish their work and return home. Birds return to their nests. The cowboys become busy with returning home with cattle. When the sun sets, nature looks very beautiful.
